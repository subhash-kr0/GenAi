       "  'body': '### Pandas version checks\\n\\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\\n\\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\\n\\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\\n\\n\\n### Reproducible Example\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\ndf = pd.DataFrame(\\r\\n    [[1, 2, 3]],\\r\\n    columns=pd.Index([\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"], name=\"alpha\")\\r\\n)\\r\\ndf.groupby(by=\"A\", as_index=False)[\"B\"].sum()\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Issue Description\\n\\nOutput of the above example:\\r\\n```\\r\\n>>> df\\r\\nalpha  A  B  C\\r\\n0      1  2  3\\r\\n>>> df.groupby(by=\"A\", as_index=False)[\"B\"].sum()\\r\\n   A  B\\r\\n0  1  2\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `name` field of the columns `Index` object is dropped after the groupby operation.\\r\\n```\\r\\n>>> df.groupby(by=\"A\", as_index=False)[\"B\"].sum().columns\\r\\nIndex([\\'A\\', \\'B\\'], dtype=\\'object\\')\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pandas 1.5, the name was retained:\\r\\n```\\r\\n>>> pd.__version__\\r\\n\\'1.5.3\\'\\r\\n>>> df.groupby(by=\"A\", as_index=False)[\"B\"].sum()\\r\\nalpha  A  B\\r\\n0      1  2\\r\\n>>> df.groupby(by=\"A\", as_index=False)[\"B\"].sum().columns\\r\\nIndex([\\'A\\', \\'B\\'], dtype=\\'object\\', name=\\'alpha\\')\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nIt is unclear whether this change was intentional between pandas 1.5/2.0; I could not find any mention of this in the issue tracker or release notes. If this was intentional, it should be mentioned briefly in groupby documentation; if not, then it should be fixed to preserve the name as before.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : 7fe86b67d3782d0c35b9284900e4aa9dd827718a\\r\\npython                : 3.11.7.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release            : 23.4.0\\r\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 23.4.0: Wed Feb 21 21:45:49 PST 2024; root:xnu-10063.101.15~2/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020\\r\\nmachine               : arm64\\r\\nprocessor             : arm\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 3.0.0.dev0+263.g7fe86b67d3\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 68.2.2\\r\\npip                   : 23.3.1\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : None\\r\\nIPython               : None\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.4\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

This will cause it to match the bold-face type description, and more importantly accurately reflect the behavior. I can submit a PR for this if that\\'s preferred.',\n",

I think it would make sense to avoid introducing np.nan, but opinions might differ on this. The important thing is that Pandas shouldn\\'t fail in this case.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : fd3f57170aa1af588ba877e8e28c158a20a4886d\\r\\npython                : 3.11.6.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 4.18.0-348.20.1.el8_5.x86_64\\r\\nVersion               : #1 SMP Thu Mar 10 20:59:28 UTC 2022\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_GB.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_GB.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.3\\r\\npytz                  : 2023.3.post1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 69.0.3\\r\\npip                   : 23.3.2\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : 7.4.4\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : 3.1.9\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 5.1.0\\r\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.3\\r\\nIPython               : 8.20.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck            : 1.3.7\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : 2023.12.2\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.2\\r\\nnumba                 : 0.58.1\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 14.0.2\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.12.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : 2024.1.0\\r\\nxlrd                  : 2.0.1\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.4\\r\\nqtpy                  : 2.4.1\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",
