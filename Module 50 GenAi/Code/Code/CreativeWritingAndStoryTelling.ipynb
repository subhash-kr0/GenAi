It was during one of these excursions that Elara first felt the stirrings of her magical potential. She had wandered off the beaten path, drawn by an inexplicable urge, and found herself in a sunlit glade where the air seemed to shimmer with an otherworldly energy.\n\nAs she stood there, entranced, Elara noticed a small injured bird struggling on the ground.

The twist comes when the detective discovers that the tycoon himself orchestrated his own murder.\n\nThe tycoon had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and, knowing he had limited time left, devised an elaborate plan to fake his own death in a way that implicated his rivals and resolved longstanding personal vendettas. He hired a look-alike to take his place and strategically manipulated those around him to ensure his plan unfolded seamlessly. The detective's revelation that the tycoon is actually alive and pulling the strings from behind the scenes turns the case on its head, forcing the detective to rethink everything he thought he knew about the case."
